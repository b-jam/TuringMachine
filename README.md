TuringMachine
=============

My simulator for a turing machine in aiding my computability &amp; complexity course
Note that L & R are reserved symbols for "Left" and "Right"
It reads in quadruples from a csv file, and takes a unary input
then processes and spits out the output

run it like this
python turingmachine.py machine1.csv 111B111

replacing machine1.csv for your csv & 111B111 for your input
