TuringMachine
=============

My simulator for a turing machine in aiding my computability & complexity course.

Note that L & R are reserved symbols for "Left" and "Right".

The program reads in quadruples from a csv file, and takes a unary input
which it processes and spits out the output

run it like this:

python turingmachine.py [csvfile] [unaryinput]

eg python turingmachine.py machine1.csv 111

The example machine1.csv does the calculation f(x) = 2x^2
